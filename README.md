# Natural Language Classifier

## Definition of Text Classification
- It is an area of AI which is natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on labeling and organizing text

## Purpose of the Service:  
- It is to quickly train custom machine learning models to analyze and label(categorize, sort or classify) your textual data in order to identify next best actions, organize your data, or analyze your data for trends and new insights. This saves a tremendous amount of time.

## Process to train a classifier: 
- Upload your CSV file with label examples, better accuracy through shorter text
- Natural Language Classifier will return the best matching classes for a sentence, phrase, or paragraph
- Training an ML classifier requires a “representational set” of training data. If we can provide an accurate sample of data that looks like the broader set, we can train on that smaller sample, giving us much quicker results.
- You can improve the performance of this classifier in two ways. The first is by defining additional target classes and providing new training data for those classes.Do not fabricate new training data, take training data directly from user input from logs or other sources. This helps ensure representativeness — no matter how clever you are any training data you fabricate is not going to match the way users interact with your system

## Various Usecases
- Analysis of AirBnb Reviews e.g. good, bad, neutral
- Job recommendations e.g. creative, technical, sales(this github example)
- Classify programming languages
- Classify spam
- sort posts on a message board 
- classify weather data e.g. conditions, temperature
- support tickets
